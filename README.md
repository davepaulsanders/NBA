# NBA SCORES AND STATS

## Concept

This web app retrieves all NBA games on the current day and displays the the teams playing, their scores, and the status of the game (i.e. 1st quarter etc). In addition, on hovering over each game, the highest scoring players for each team are listed.

## Technologies Used

This was built using the React framework.

The API I used is called BallDontLie, which is found here: https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction. It updates roughly every ten minutes.

### Future improvements

- Adding a section to show stats of all players in the game on click.
